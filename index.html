                        Speech Server. This platform for doing large-scale speech recognition was aimed primarily at telephony and support center uses. Specifically, Derek ran the SDK team. Although throughout his Microsoft career Derek managed between
                        2 and 4 direct reports, it is during this period where Derek's team grew to support a larger project and at the peak of the effort Derek managed a team of 20 developers, testers, and designers who were delivering the software development
                        kit for the speech server and designing the user interface for the product. As the speech server neared shipping, the team moved out of the Natural User Interface division and back into Windows and Derek took on an individual contributor
                        project to create the "How-Do-I" language model. This was derived from typed text data, modified algorithmically to adapt to spoken language patterns, and shipped with windows so that users could request help on operating system

                    <p> Derek left Microsoft to return to Canada, specifically to pursue graduate work at the University of Victoria (UVic). The interest in speech recognition and computer-mediated interpersonal dynamics led to a master's thesis topic of
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/3155">Collaborative and Automatic Annotations to Meetings</a>. In this project, Derek used both automatic speech recognition and iClickers (a student annotation
                        device used primarily for in-class quizes) to annotate a class record with important points. This was developed in C# and Microsoft Silverlight as a web application. User studies showed that these annotations were able to significantly
                        increase the value of class recordings to subsequent information extraction tasks.</p>
                    <p> During this time Derek also developed a deep interest in biology, specifically the emerging field of synthetic biology. Taking many undergraduate courses in microbiolgy, genetics, and bioinformatics laid an academic framework, but
                        the most exciting applications of the field lay in practical applications. Derek founded the first iGEM team at UVic. iGEM, international Genetically Engineered Machines, is a yearly synthetic biology competition sponsored by MIT.
                        The UVic team took a silver medal in this competition for the creation and characterization of a bacterial thermometer.</p>

                    <p> During his time at Microsoft, Derek built a house. A 3500 square foot geodesic dome for which he acted as general contractor and carpenter. The woodworking was interesting enough that after leaving Microsoft Derek attended the Northwest
                        school of wooden boatbuilding to learn how to build a mast and replace planks on his 1951 William Garden designed pinky schooner. As he was settling into Victoria, Derek's woodworking and mechanical hobbies, not to mention a growing
                        accumulation of biology gear, began to overwhelm his garage. At the same time, the lack of a cohesive technically-oriented social network was a growing concern. Unlike the vast tech community in Seattle or the San Francisco Bay
                        area, Victoria was lacking social opportunities.</p>
                    <p>The solution was to found a Makerspace. This is a community-organized non-profit workshop which provides workshop space, classes, and social opportunities to its members. The Victoria Makerspace began as a modest affair in 600 square
                        feet of outbuilding in a farmer's field, but by today has grown to 150 members and over 4000 square feet of workshop space in the Vancouver Island Technology Park.</p>
                    <p> Under Derek's leadership as executive director, members have built out metal shops for welding, sheet metal work, and milling and metal lathes. A woodworking shop. An electronics shop. A molecular biology lab, Canada's first community
                        biology lab in fact, which Derek has gone to Ottawa to represent to Health Canada as a growing trend of interest in science education. Makerspace has two laser cutters, three 3D printers, a green screen recording studio with music
                        and filmmaking gear, a computer classroom, and an ever-growing virtual reality lab. The Victoria Makerspace has received national and local press and television coverage, seen the formation of numerous inventions and small businesses

                    <p> Although the Makerspace biology lab is a good teaching lab, Derek's molecular and synthetic biology aspirations required a more comprehensive space. He founded a scientific consultancy company called Biobit enterprises and fitted out
                        a lab next to Makerspace. This lab is designed as a biosafety level 2 facility, meaning that it is capable of handling infectious materials when certified to do so by Health Canada, and contains microscopy facilities, microbiology
                        facilities for the culture and analysis of bacteria, yeast, and algae. Culture facilities for plants and worms. Genetic analysis facilities including quantitative polymerase chain reaction equipment (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing
                        equipment from Illumina. And chemistry and protein analysis gear, including nano-particle production and purification capabilities. An early effort to engage in micro-fluidic processing gear is also underway in collaboration with
                        other Makerspace members.</p>
                    <p> Although the commercial activities of Biobit have ebbed and flowed with the time-pressures of Makerspace and UVic activities, the focus on biotechnology afforded by a dedicated space has allowed Derek to be a regular contributor to
                        biotech publications such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oreilly.com/biocoder/">BioCoder</a>, and to pursue longer term development projects. Derek gave a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkrMbW6eL0U">TEDxVictoria</a>                        talk on the importance of focusing on biotechnology.</p>

                    <p> Singularity University (SU) is a technology entrepreneurship program at Nasa Ames founded by Ray Kurzweil and Peter Diamandis. Based on the idea of exponentials changing the face of technology, and the world, the summer global solutions
                        program focuses students on global grand challenges that effect a billion or more people. In my first year there, I attended as a student and led the construction efforts on a project to develop aeroponic vegetable growth chambers.
                        In subsequent summers I have attended as a biotechnology instructor and led students through DNA transformations, human genetic testing, DNA species barcoding, and the development of many fascinating group project ideas. Now directly
                        supported by Google, the network of SU graduates and sponsors is a window into the heart of silicon valley and an ideal marriage of technology and business. <a target="_blank" href="http://singularityu.org/">Singularity University</a></p>
                    <p> It was also at Singularity University that I met Raymond McCauley and the other folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://biocurious.org/">BioCurious</a>, a biology-focused hackerspace in Sunnyvale. With the resources of silicon valley
                        and its ability to dream big, BioCurious has been an example to aspire to in the development of Makerspace. I helped them initially create their lab, and have also used the lab to teach the SU classes. It was also there that I
                        led the lab portion of the 2012 FBI-organized DIY bio summit. This international gathering of community labs was the first time that the global scale of the community lab movement was realized.</p>

                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> Derek's PhD at the University of Victoria was co-supervised by both psychology and computer science. It focused on the use of <a target="_blank" href="https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/7510">consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) headsets for the diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit disorder</a>.
                        These EEG headsets, costing several hundred dollars rather than the tens of thousands of dollars research grade equipment costs, were previously thought to be too unreliable for research use and were intended primarily for computer
                        gaming and meditation training applications. Rather than their intended use of monitoring recurring frontal lobe activity, Derek used the equipment to detect stimulus-locked neural activity - specific brain responses to an on-screen
                        stimulus. These event-related potentials (ERPs) are the basis of many psychological and neurological studies, and various clinical conditions exhibit systematic changes in the pattern or ERPs observed. In the particular case Derek
                        was studying, an ERP called the P300 was observed to be attenuated in the case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Derek used noise reduction algorithms to reduce the impact of lower-quality headsets, and machine
                        learning techniques to determine when P300 responses were observed. These responses were used to create a brain-controlled spelling package which was used as a form of neurofeedback. After multiple sessions of using the apparatus,
                        the P300 responses were found to have strengthened in normal subject populations. It remains to be seen whether this holds true in ADHD populations and whether behavioral correlates of the altered brain responses can be determined.</p>

                    <p> As the PhD was winding down, Derek took a turn back towards user interface design in working with UrtheCast, a satellite imagery company, to produce a development console for writing python scripts to analyze earth imagery data. Hosted
                        on Amazon Web Services (AWS) the web application uses React and ES6 and follows modern web development practices in an application framework which leverages parallel computing to run the imagery analyses in a map-reduce paradigm.
                        Derek architected the technical direction and has been supervising students at UVic and coordinating with developers and remote sensing scientists at UrtheCast to release this development environment on the UrtheCast platform.</p>
                    <p> Derek has also been working in the Unity development engine and has owned an Oculus virtual reality headset since the DK1 was released in 2013. Derek is co-organizer of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/VVAR-Victoria-Virtual-Augmented-Reality/">Victoria Virtual and Augmented Reality Meetup</a>.
                        With more hardware on the way, the Victoria Makerspace is home to a group of VR and AR enthusiasts in this rapidly growing development area.</p>
